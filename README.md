# What is MRBFMC?
<p>Moo's Random Bot For Minecraft (MRBFMC) is used to create a bot that can join any Minecraft Server from you choosing and stay on there until bot stops</p>

# Can you use it to keep Aternos server online?

<p>Yes but we don't recommend it, your Aternos account could get banned for using MRBFMC, if you do use it for keeping a Aternos Server online your risking your account to get banned</p>
